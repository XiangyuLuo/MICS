Description: In current epigenome-wide mediation analysis, we can only identify DNA methylation CpG sites that mediate a causal effect. Because the methylation values are mixed from a heterogeneous population of cells, it is crucial to get fine-grained results by detecting mediation CpG sites in a cell-typespecific way. The MICS package has the function to identify cell-type-specific mediation effects in genome-wide epigenetic studies and is user-friendly.
