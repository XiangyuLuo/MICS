MICS is short for "Mediation In a Cell-type-Specific fashion" and is implemented as an R package here to test cell-type-specific mediation effects in the epigenome wide mediation analysis.

The R code to run MICS can be seen in the example of the function mics.

Installation instruction:
```
devtools::install_github("XiangyuLuo/MICS")
```

See an example:
```
library(MICS)
example(mics)
```

Check how to use the mics function using:

```
?mics
```

Please see the R file in the demo folder to generate the simulation data, run MICS and compute power and false negative rates.
